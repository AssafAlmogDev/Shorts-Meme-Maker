## How to Use

Run the application by executing:

```

Once started, please wait a few moments for the content to load. Memes will begin appearing automatically.

Instructions:
Read each meme carefully.
Note: You are being recorded from the moment the program starts.

After reading each meme, click "Next" to proceed to the next one.

After the 5th meme, a message will appear saying "Finish". No further action is needed.

The program will automatically begin processing and generate the final video file:
finish.mp4

‚è≥ Please be patient ‚Äî rendering the video may take some time depending on your system performance.

**The video will also need Ko-Fi.png in the folder with the .py, but you can remove the section in the code.**
